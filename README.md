### Are "Free Amazon Gift Card Codes" Real?
The promise of free Amazon gift card codes is alluring, but the reality is often disappointing. Many websites and apps advertise "free Amazon gift cards" with the intent of attracting users to click on shady links, fill out surveys, or download suspicious software. 
While there are some legitimate ways to earn Amazon gift cards (such as through reward programs, surveys, or cashback offers), there are no trustworthy websites or services that give out completely free Amazon gift card codes with no strings attached. If a site promises free Amazon gift cards in exchange for little to no effort, be cautiousâ€”it could be a scam.
### Common Scams and Risks
Several scams prey on individuals looking for free Amazon gift card codes. Here are some of the most common scams to be aware of:
1. **Survey Scams**: Many websites claim you can earn free gift cards by completing surveys. While there are some legitimate survey websites, others are just collecting your personal information or leading you down a path of never-ending offers without actually rewarding you.
2. **Fake Giveaway Contests**: Be wary of social media contests or posts that claim youâ€™ve won a free Amazon gift card. Often, these "giveaways" require you to click on a link and provide personal information, or share your email and phone number.
3. **Phishing Websites**: Some scammers create fake Amazon websites or apps that look real, asking you to enter personal details or payment information in exchange for a free gift card. These sites are designed to steal your data.
4. **Downloading Suspicious Apps**: There are apps that promise free Amazon gift card codes but ask you to download other apps or perform tasks that donâ€™t actually result in any reward. These apps can often be a gateway for malware.
### How to Earn Amazon Gift Cards Legally
While free Amazon gift card codes aren't typically given out without any work involved, there are legitimate ways to earn Amazon gift cards:

1. **Amazon's Own Programs**:
   - **Amazon Rewards Visa Card**: If you're a frequent shopper, applying for an Amazon Rewards Visa Card can give you cashback points, which can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards.
   - **Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)**: MTurk allows you to complete microtasks for payment in Amazon gift cards.
   - **Amazon Trade-In Program**: You can trade in used electronics, books, or games for Amazon gift cards. This is a great way to declutter your home while earning credit toward your Amazon purchases.

2. **Survey and Reward Websites**:
   - **Swagbucks**: One of the most popular reward sites where you can earn points (called "SB") for completing surveys, watching videos, or shopping online. These points can be exchanged for Amazon gift cards.
   - **InboxDollars**: Another legitimate site that pays you for completing tasks, such as surveys or reading emails. You can cash out your earnings for Amazon gift cards.
   - **PrizeRebel**: Similar to Swagbucks, PrizeRebel offers a variety of ways to earn points, including completing surveys and offers, which can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards.

3. **Cashback Apps**:
   - Apps like **Rakuten**, **Dosh**, or **Ibotta** allow you to earn cashback from qualifying purchases. You can then redeem the cashback for Amazon gift cards, making your shopping experience more affordable.

### How to Avoid Scams

When searching for ways to earn Amazon gift cards, it's important to be cautious. Here are a few tips to help you avoid scams:

- **Stick to well-known platforms**: Use reputable platforms like Amazonâ€™s official rewards programs, Swagbucks, and InboxDollars. Check for reviews and ratings before engaging with any new site.
- **Don't trust unrealistic promises**: If a website promises free Amazon gift cards with little to no effort, it's probably a scam.
- **Watch out for phishing**: Never enter your Amazon login credentials or payment information on a site that looks suspicious. Always double-check the URL and verify its legitimacy.
- **Avoid offers that require payment**: Legitimate reward programs never ask for money upfront in exchange for a free gift card.

### Conclusion
